WP-CRM System is a fully featured CRM designed to work exclusively with WordPress.

== Description ==
WP-CRM System is a fully featured CRM that allows you to use the WordPress interface you are already familiar with to manage your customers, projects, and tasks with ease.

Why spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a CRM that charges based on the number of records you have in your database, or the number of users that you have accessing your database? WP-CRM System allows you to have an unlimited number of records and lets you give everyone in your organization access to the data they need to drive business.

**More than a CRM**

WP-CRM System allows your team to manage projects, assign individual tasks, track marketing campaigns, and helps convert your opportunities into successes!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What makes WP-CRM System different from other CRM\'s? =
Many other CRM\'s are hosted on the CRM company\'s servers, which requires you to maintain an active subscription in order to access YOUR data. WP-CRM System gives you control over your data by keeping it all contained on your website. You own it all and no one can ever keep you from it - just like it should be. There are no expensive contracts required in order for you to access your customer\'s information.

= What if I am coming from another CRM, can I import my data? = 
Absolutely. There are inexpensive extensions that allow you to import as little or as much information as you need to into WP-CRM System.

= Is my data secure? = 
Your data is only accessible through the WordPress dashboard. None of it will be accessible through the public facing portion of your website. This allows you to provide access to as few or as many people as you need to.
